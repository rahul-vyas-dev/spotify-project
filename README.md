# Spotify Project

A visually rich, Spotify-inspired web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is my first project at the very beginning of my coding journey, created when I started learning web development and did not know any frameworks or libraries. It features a custom UI, artist profiles, song lists, and interactive elements, designed to mimic the look and feel of Spotify.

**Important:**

- You must clone this project into your `C:` directory (e.g., `C:\spotify-project`). The app uses your local file paths to run and relies on a local server to make API requests.
- This project does **not** use any frameworks or libraries—just basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for DOM manipulation.
- There is **no .env file** or environment configuration. This is a simple, static project.

## Features

- Custom SVG icons and images for a modern UI
- Artist profiles and song lists organized by folders
- Responsive design with CSS
- Easy navigation and user-friendly layout
- Ready for further development (audio playback, playlists, etc.)
